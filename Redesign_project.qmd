### Redesign 1:

The report used for redesign 1 is shown below [@pewresearchUSNewsroom]

![](Redesign1/news_report_data.png)

The above chart is a comparison between Newspaper Publishers and Digital Native employment. Although this visualization shows change over time for Newspaper Publishers and Digital Native, there are a few disadvantages in the data. This includes:

1.   As you can see only the starting values and ending values for both variables are shown making it harder to see the change over time. This is a hindrance since it limits the chartâ€™s ability to provide detailed insights.

2.   The visualization also does not effectively show that Newspaper Publisher's employment has decreased while Digital-Native employment has increased. Also, the Newspaper Publishers line is darker making it more prominent compared to the Digital Native line.

Based on the disadvantages of this visualization, we wanted to create re-designs to accurately show the changing trends for both Newspaper Publishers and Digital Native employment.

```{r}
#Importing necessary modules
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
#Getting the types of news publisher data
df = read.csv('Redesign1/news_report_data.csv')

```

From this dataset, we will extract only the Year, Total, Newspaper Publishers and Digital Native to analyze the data.

```{r}
df1 = df[c('Year','Total','Newspaper.publishers','Digital..native')]

```

Now gathering 'Newspaper.publishers' and 'Digital..native' under the column Sector and its value under the Employment so that creating a graph for each sector would be easy for us.

```{r}
data_long <- gather(df1, key = "Sector", value = "Employment", -Year, -Total)

```

Below is the first visualization we will create to show the trend between the two sectors. We used geom_point to show the dots and geom_segment for the black lines connecting both sectors.

```{r}
plot1=ggplot(data_long, aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = Employment, color = Sector,label=Sector)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = as.factor(Year), yend = 0), color = "black", size = 0.5) +  # Black horizontal lines
  geom_point(size = 3) +  # Points for each sector and year above the line
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_discrete() +
  labs(title = "Newsroom Employment in US for Newspaper Publisher vs Digital Native",
       x = "Year", y = "Employment")
ggplotly(plot1,tooltip = c("y","label"))
```

Based on the above visualization, we can see the change in employment for both sectors. Unlike the original visualization, we can see the change between Newspaper Publishers and Digital Native employment throughout the years. Along with that, we can see the difference in both sectors change overtime where there is less of an employment distance as the year progresses. \

```{r}
plot2 = ggplot(data_long,aes(x=as.factor(Year),y=Employment,fill = Sector,label=Sector))+geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge",width = 0.75)+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))+scale_x_discrete()+labs(title = "Newsroom employment in US for Newspaper Publisher vs Digital Native",x="Year",y="Employment")
ggplotly(plot2,tooltip = c("y","label"))
```

We also made a re-design for the same report but a stacked bar graph instead.

In this stacked bar graph, we can see that the Digital Native employment is a lot less compared to the Newspaper Publisher employment in 2008. There is a sharp decreasing slope for Newspaper Publisher and increasing slope for Digital Native. We used the ggplotly package and geom_bar to show the bars to display this visualization.

As the employment rate for both sectors varies, we can see in 2020 that the employment difference between the two is very minor.

Other than re-designing the original visualization, we want to expand and analyze the percentage changes in each sector per year.

```{r}
#Table that contains %change in their employment from previous year

data_long <- data_long %>%
  arrange(Sector, Year) %>% # Sort by sector and year
  group_by(Sector) %>%
  mutate(Percentage_Change = (Employment - lag(Employment)) / lag(Employment) * 100)
```

```{r}
plot3=ggplot(data_long,aes(x=as.factor(Year),y=round(Percentage_Change,2),fill=Sector,label=Sector))+geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge",width=0.75)+scale_x_discrete()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))+labs(title = "% Change of the Sectors in the trend over years",x="Year",y="Percentage Change")
ggplotly(plot3,tooltip = c("y","label"))
```

From this graph, we can see that Newspaper Publisher started to decrease drastically by -14.49% in 2009 and continued to decrease. Digital Native has increased by 9.32% in 2014, and it decreased by -0.62%. After 2014, Digital Native began to fluctuate as the years went on. We used group_by and mutate to show the difference over the years. We also used ggplotly and the arrange function.

Next, we will analyze the data to understand how much employment in each sector has changed compared to overall sector employment.

```{r}
#Getting percentage value of each sectors}
df$Percent_of_newspaper_publisher = df$Newspaper.publishers/df$Total
df$Percent_of_digital_native = df$Digital..native/df$Total
df$Percent_of_other_sector = (df$Broadcast.television + df$Radio.broadcasting + df$Cable.television)/df$Total
```

```{r}
sector_percent_data <- df %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(Percent_of_newspaper_publisher,Percent_of_digital_native,Percent_of_other_sector),names_to = "Sector",values_to = 'Percentage') %>% select(Year,Sector,Percentage)

```

```{r}
ggplot(sector_percent_data,aes(x=as.factor(Year),y=Percentage,fill = Sector))+geom_bar(stat = "identity")+geom_text(aes(label = round(Percentage,2)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),angle = 90)+scale_x_discrete()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))+labs(title = "% of employment of the Sectors over years",x="Year",y="Percentage of Employment")

```

Based on the above visualization, we can see that in 2008 Newspaper Publishers employment is ten times more than Digital Native employment. As time progresses, we can see a change in both sectors in 2020 where Newspaper Publisher Employment is 36% and Digital Native employment is 21%. We used geom_text to show the percentages in the bars and position to stack the bars.

#### Comment:

From the initial report, we can see the change overtime, but it only shows the starting and ending values for both. Although it shows a major difference in both sectors, our re-design makes it easier for viewers to see the changes from 2008 to 2020.

### Redesign 2:

The report used for redesign 2 is shown below [@covid]

![](Redesign2/Total%20Death%20Final.jpeg)

The original graph is a bar chart that displays different countries and the number of COVID deaths. The disadvantages of the original graph are:

-   It is hard to tell which country has the most COVID deaths compared to the least COVID deaths.

-   In addition, no x-axis or y-axis labels is making it hard for the reader to know what they are looking at.

-   Lastly, there is no absolute zero value which should be included for readability.

```{r}
#Importing Packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales))
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)

```

```{r}
#Reading Dataset
covid_total_deaths = read.csv("Redesign2/COVID Analysis Total Deaths.csv")
head(covid_total_deaths)
```

```{r}
#Bar Plot Descending Re-Design
death_plot1 <- ggplot(covid_total_deaths, aes(x = reorder(Country, -Total.Deaths), y = Total.Deaths)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") + labs(x = "Country", y = "Total Deaths", title = "Bar Graph For Total COVID Deaths By Country") + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) + scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")) 
death_plot1
```

To improve the original visualization, a bar graph can be created in descending order to show which COVID deaths by country. This bar graph would have an x-axis containing the country names and a y-axis containing the number of total deaths. As you can see, the number of COVID deaths decreases as you move down the x-axis.

```{r}
#Scatter Plot Descending Re-Design
death_plot2 <- ggplot(covid_total_deaths, aes(x = reorder(Country, -Total.Deaths), y = Total.Deaths)) +  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = "red", color = "black", size = 3) + labs(title = "Scatter Plot For Total COVID Deaths By Country", x = "Country", y = "Total Deaths") + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(covid_total_deaths$Total.Deaths) + 1000), labels = label_number(big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = "."))
death_plot2
```

Another re-design that can be created is a scatter plot. This is better because instead of seeing bars, dots are more visually appealing. The x-axis and y-axis labels would be the same as the bar graph. The scatter plot above shows COVID deaths by country in descending order. As you can see the US has the most COVID deaths and Iraq has the least COVID deaths. Based on other visualizations, China has the most COVID dosages given therefore their death rate is lower. The US has the third most COVID dosages but still has the highest number of deaths. Based on this information, there is no direct correlation between dosages given and COVID deaths.

I gathered data for COVID deaths and decided to organize the data in descending order for readability. For the scatter plot, we used geom_point to show the red dots for COVID deaths. On the bar graph, we used geom_bar to display bars for the COVID deaths in blue. Both re-designs display the same information in different ways.

#### Comment:

In conclusion, the next re-design that can be done for this dataset is a map visualization showing low and high concentrations of COVID deaths per country. Countries with higher deaths can be in a darker color and the countries with lower deaths can be in a lighter color. To complete this visualization, we will need to add latitude and longitude values of the countries to accurately show and depict the data. Overall, our re-design is much better than the original visualization because it is easier to see which countries are most affected by COVID deaths.
