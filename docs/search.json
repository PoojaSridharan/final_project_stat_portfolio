But as time passes we can see a simultaneous change in both the trends in the year of 2020 newspaper publisher employment is 36% and digital native employment is 21%\n\nComment:\nFrom the initial report, we can able to witness the change in trend but not clear as it depicts the value only at the start and end, secondly even though we can see a sharp shift in both the trends, from the redesign we can able to understand further, how much %change happened for both the sector over the year and how much changes happened in these two sectors employment in the newsroom at the year 2008 and the year 2020.\nHence these redesign helps to understand the change in trend a bit more clear.\n\n\n\nRedesign 2:\nThe report used for redesign 2 is shown below\n\nThe original graph was a bar chart that displayed different countries and the number of COVID deaths in each country. The disadvantages of the original graph are you cannot tell which countries have more COVID deaths than others as well as having the bars horizontal makes it harder for the viewer to visualize.\nIn addition, there was no labels making the graph not complete in a sense no x-axis and y-axis on the graph, labels would it make it much easier for the viewer to see.\nThis visualization shows which countries had many COVID deaths compared to others, but currently this visualization makes it hard for the reader to see which country has the most total deaths from COVID.\n\n#Importing Packages\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales))\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n#Reading Dataset\ncovid_total_deaths = read.csv(\"Redesign2/COVID Analysis Total Deaths.csv\")\nhead(covid_total_deaths)\n\n     Country Total.Deaths\n1  Argentina       130472\n2 Bangladesh        29445\n3    Belgium        33814\n4     Brazil       699276\n5   Bulgaria        38228\n6     Canada        51720\n\n\nTo improve the original visualization, a bar graph can be created in descending order to show which countries have the most COVID deaths. This bar graph would have an x-axis containing the country names and y-axis containing the total deaths. You will see the decline in COVID deaths as you move down the x-axis.\n\n#Bar Plot Descending Re-Design\ndeath_plot1 &lt;- ggplot(covid_total_deaths, aes(x = reorder(Country, -Total.Deaths), y = Total.Deaths)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"blue\") + labs(x = \"Country\", y = \"Total Deaths\", title = \"Bar Graph For Total COVID Deaths By Country\") + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) + scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(big.mark = \",\", decimal.mark = \".\")) \ndeath_plot1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph you can able to see the decline in COVID deaths as you move down the x-axis.\nAnother re-design that can be done is a scatter plot to also show the COVID deaths per country. This is better because instead of seeing many different bars you can see dots so that its easier to read. The x-axis would also be country name, and y-axis would be number of COVID deaths.\n\n#Scatter Plot Descending Re-Design\ndeath_plot2 &lt;- ggplot(covid_total_deaths, aes(x = reorder(Country, -Total.Deaths), y = Total.Deaths)) +  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = \"red\", color = \"black\", size = 3) + labs(title = \"Scatter Plot For Total COVID Deaths By Country\", x = \"Country\", y = \"Total Deaths\") + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(covid_total_deaths$Total.Deaths) + 1000), labels = label_number(big.mark = \",\", decimal.mark = \".\"))\ndeath_plot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot above shows COVID deaths by countries in descending order. As you can see the US has the most COVID deaths and Iraq with the least COVID deaths. China has the most COVID dosages given therefore their death rate is the least compared to other countries.\n\nComment:\nI gathered data for COVID deaths and decided to organize the data in descending order so it was easier to see which countries had more COVID deaths and the least COVID deaths. For the scatter plot we used geom_point so that we can show the scatter plot values on the graph and made the dots red. On the bar graph we used geom_bar to display bars for the COVID deaths in blue. Both re-designs show countries from most COVID deaths to least COVID deaths meaning it was organized in descending order by country."
